## __Setup & Installation__

### ⚠️ Python Version Requirement

**This project REQUIRES Python 3.8-3.13 (NOT 3.14+)**

ChromaDB and onnxruntime do NOT support Python 3.14 yet. If you use Python 3.14, installation will fail.

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended for Production)**
```bash
# Create .env file with your API keys (see DOCKER.md)
# Then build and run:
docker-compose up -d

# Or use the helper script:
./docker-run.sh build
./docker-run.sh run

# View logs:
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Option 2: Automated Setup (Local Development)**
```bash
./setup_venv.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Option 3: Manual Setup**
```bash
# Use python3.13 explicitly (DO NOT use 'python' or 'python3' as they may default to 3.14)
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation

**For Docker:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**For Local:**
```bash
python --version  # Should show Python 3.13.x
pip list | grep onnxruntime  # Should show onnxruntime>=1.19.0
```

## __System Overview__

This is a __comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system__ with __knowledge gap filling capabilities__ designed to automatically enhance content creation by researching and adding missing knowledge to existing content collections.

## __Core Architecture__

### __1. Main RAG Engine (`main.py`)__

- __Flask-based REST API__ with multiple query endpoints

- __Dynamic embedding dimension detection__ (128D optimized vs 1536D standard)

- __Multiple query strategies__:

  - Simple similarity search
  - Hybrid enhanced search with importance weighting
  - Agentic iterative search with multiple rounds
  - Truly agentic search that auto-selects best strategy
  - Fixed agentic search with verbosity control

### __2. Knowledge Gap Filler (`knowledge_gap_http_supabase.py`)__

- __Automated content enhancement__ system that:

  - Identifies knowledge gaps in existing content
  - Researches missing information from multiple sources
  - Adds new documents to vector store
  - Provides manual action suggestions

## __Key Components__

### __Knowledge Gap Analysis__

- __Analyzes NEW status titles__ to identify missing knowledge
- __Rule-based categorization__ of topics (real estate, finance, technology, etc.)

- __Background processing__ for large documents
- __Chunking and embedding__ into vector store
- __Metadata preservation__ with source attribution

### __Collection Management__

- __Flexible collection strategies__:

  - Single collection for all content
  - Merge with existing collections
  - Topic-based auto-grouping
  - Individual title collections

- __User-specific collections__ with proper isolation

## __API Endpoints__

### __Core RAG Endpoints__

- `/enhance_additional_knowledge/<title_id>` - Add more knowledge to enhanced titles

### __Management Endpoints__

- `/upload` - Upload and parse documents
- `/chunk` - Process documents into vector store
- `/job_status/<job_id>` - Async job tracking
- `/validate_knowledge_gap_setup` - System validation

## __Advanced Features__

### __Manual Action Suggestions__
