# Manus-wide Research Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Manus-wide research suggestion system into the existing knowledge gap filler. This system automatically detects when standard research yields insufficient results and suggests enabling advanced Manus-wide research capabilities.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Research Quality Detection
- **Location**: `knowledge_gap_http_supabase.py` in `MultiSourceResearcher` class
- **Method**: `_calculate_research_quality()`
- **Function**: Analyzes research results and assigns quality score (0-100)
- **Threshold**: Scores below 30 trigger Manus-wide research suggestions

### 2. Manus-wide Research Suggestions
- **Location**: `manual_action_suggestions.py`
- **New Action Type**: `MANUS_WIDE_RESEARCH` added to `ActionType` enum
- **Method**: `suggest_manus_wide_research()` generates high-priority suggestions
- **Integration**: Automatically triggered when `research_quality_score < 30`

### 3. Configuration System
- **Location**: `manus_research_config.py`
- **Features**:
  - Configurable quality thresholds
  - Feature flags for different capabilities
  - Advanced research APIs configuration
  - Environment variable support

### 4. Workflow Integration
- **Location**: `WorkFlow_to_close_all_gaps.py`
- **Integration**: Automatic suggestion generation during gap closure workflow
- **Trigger**: Insufficient research results (<30 quality score)

## How It Works

### Quality Assessment Process
1. **Source Count**: Up to 40 points based on total sources found
2. **Diversity**: Up to 30 points for variety of source types
3. **Quality**: Up to 30 points for authoritative sources (academic, government, industry)

### Suggestion Generation
When research quality score < 30:
1. System automatically generates Manus-wide research suggestion
2. Suggestion is saved to `manual_action_suggestions` table
3. High priority (CRITICAL/CRITICAL) assigned for immediate attention
4. Includes detailed benefits and implementation guidance

### Manus-wide Research Features
- **AI-powered semantic search** across proprietary databases
- **Access to expert networks** and specialized knowledge bases
- **Advanced data synthesis** and analysis capabilities
- **Real-time market intelligence** and trend analysis
- **Cross-platform knowledge integration**

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Detection
```python
# When processing knowledge gaps
research_results = await researcher.research_knowledge_gap(gap)
if research_results['manus_suggestion_needed']:
    # Suggestion automatically generated and saved
    logger.info("Manus-wide research suggestion created")
```

### Manual Configuration
```python
# Configure thresholds via environment variables
export MANUS_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_LOW=25
export MANUS_ENABLE_EXPERT_NETWORKS=true
export MANUS_MAX_CONCURRENT_SEARCHES=10
```

## Database Schema Updates

### manual_action_suggestions Table
- Added `manus_wide_research` to `action_type` enum
- Enhanced with research quality tracking
- Added research context JSON field

## Testing

### Configuration Test
```bash
python -c "
from manus_research_config import ResearchQualityAnalyzer
results = {'total_sources': 2, 'sources_found': {...}}
assessment = ResearchQualityAnalyzer.assess_research_quality(results)
print(f'Score: {assessment[\"overall_score\"]}/100')
print(f'Manus needed: {assessment[\"manus_research_needed\"]}')
"
```

### Integration Test
The system automatically tests quality thresholds and suggestion generation during normal operation.

## Environment Variables

### Core Configuration
```bash
# Quality thresholds
MANUS_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_LOW=30
MANUS_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM=60
MANUS_QUALITY_THRESHOLD_HIGH=85

# Feature flags
MANUS_WIDE_RESEARCH_ENABLED=true
MANUS_ADVANCED_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
MANUS_EXPERT_NETWORK_ENABLED=true

# Performance settings
MANUS_MAX_CONCURRENT_SEARCHES=5
MANUS_SEARCH_TIMEOUT=30
MANUS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Quality Metrics Tracked
- Research quality scores for all gaps
- Suggestion generation frequency
- Manus research activation rate
